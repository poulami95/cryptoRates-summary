Hi All :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: ,

Welcome to this repository :smile:

This is a hands on project on reactjs where i have displayed few crytovalues :heavy_dollar_sign: .It's a one page application where the user can view some selected cryto currencies rate displayed in form of cards. On click of every card you will be taken to the [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) page for that crypto coin where you can view the stats for the coin. 

The data for this website has been derived from :arrow_right:
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&ids={CRYPTO-VALUE-ID}. You can simply make a rest call to this link with crypto-id of your choice. For more details on the api please visit :  https://www.coingecko.com/en/api .

You can view the website over here :

You may also clone the repo and simply type **npm start** to view the project on your **http://localhost:3000/**. But before that don't forget to run **npm install** to install all the dependencies :wink: .

If you like this repo don't forget to give me a star :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: .

Have a great day !!!
